The main file to edit is `2020_202Z_pre-assignment.Rmd` (The Rmarkdown)

- The .R script is derivative of the Rmd, using `knitr::purl`. Do _not_ edit the R script directly.
- The solution/distribution versions are derivative of the Rmd. Toggle the `sol` / `solutions` parameter directly to compile different versions. Do _not_ make different Rmds for the solutions vs. distribution
