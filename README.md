This repo contains an exercise package guiding students through data analysis in R.

Students who have had no experience in R will be able to follow along from the beginning, and complete initial exercises without in-person classes.  Past iterations of this exercise show that students find self-guided exercises like this with plenty of references helpful, even more so than standard lectures.

The main file to edit is `pre-assignment.Rmd` (The Rmarkdown).

- The .R script is derivative of the Rmd, using `knitr::purl`. Do _not_ edit the R script directly.
- The solution/distribution versions are derivative of the Rmd. Toggle the `sol` / `solutions` parameter directly to compile different versions. Do _not_ make different Rmds for the solutions vs. distribution
